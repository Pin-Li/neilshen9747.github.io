**Candidate at Simon Business School**

Welcome to my personal website! I am Pin, currently a candidate of the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at Simon Business School, University of Rochester, and right now in pursuit of a career as a data-driven decision maker. I can work full-time in May 2020. You can check my [Data Analytical Project](https://pin-li.github.io/DataAnalyticalProject/) and [Business Case Study](https://pin-li.github.io/BusinessCaseStudy/), where I show all my data-related project work and case studies.

**Lean Project Manager**

Prior to Simon, I graduated from Penn State Univerisity with a degree in Supply Chain and Information System. That was why I then worked for one year for Banggood Inc. in eCommerce industry as a lean project manager in charge of international warehousing and logistics, including two warehouses located in the United States. That was when I combined my business sense, process mapping and data analysis skill to drive decisions in lean project management.

**Business Analyst**

During the time dealing with data in each project, I found myself obsessed with the story hidden in the data. I then transferred to eCommerce Sales Department as a business analyst in the same company. Banggood's structured and complete database for online data and hive environment enabled me to retrieve data using SQL to do analysis for various purposes. I could say I was very confident in SQL and Tableau, but I was eager to learn more in data analytics, especially coding in R and Python, so I went back to Simon Business School to have myself systematically educated with cutting-edge technology in business analytics.

**Storyteller**

Life is beautiful. Life is complicated. Life is beautiful because of its complexity.
I regard myself as a storyteller for two reasons:
Firstly, I am a professional data analyst, and will tell you the story hidden by the data where you cannot see from the surface.
Secondly, I am an amateur photographer, and want to tell you the story that I happened to see with my eyes.
